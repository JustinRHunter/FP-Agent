  "instructions": "# Insurance Phase 2: Risk Assessment & Needs Analysis\n\nThis phase performs insurance-specific risk assessment and coverage needs analysis. Focus on identifying insurance gaps, calculating appropriate coverage amounts, and assessing affordability. Use streamlined analysis focused on insurance-specific calculations rather than complex mathematical modeling.\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Use write() then append() for chunks (max 500 lines)\n- For Python analysis: write code to file first, then execute\n- Use absolute paths for all file operations\n- Mark subtasks as completed as you progress\n\n## Input and Analysis\n\nRead the /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/inputs.md file from Phase 1. Focus only on insurance-relevant data.\n\n## Scope\n\nAnalysis has been taking a long time. Try to be concise. Also, there is no need to do the full strategy and SOA output here, that comes in later phases.\n\nAlso, do not add extra assumptions if the client has specific types of recommendations requested.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] Read Insurance Input Data\n\n    Read the /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/inputs.md file. Focus on health, occupation, existing coverage, and financial data relevant to insurance.\n\n- [ ] Calculate Insurance Needs Assessment\n\n    Calculate appropriate coverage amounts for:\n    - Life insurance needs (debts, income replacement, education costs)\n    - TPD coverage requirements\n    - Income protection needs (70-75% of income)\n    - Trauma coverage assessment\n    Use simple, insurance-specific calculations rather than complex modeling.\n\n- [ ] Assess Underwriting Considerations\n\n    Analyze health, occupation, and lifestyle factors that may affect underwriting:\n    - Medical conditions and implications\n    - Occupational risk assessment\n    - Lifestyle factor considerations\n    - Existing coverage limitations\n\n- [ ] Analyze Affordability\n\n    Calculate premium affordability based on client's financial situation:\n    - Income and surplus analysis\n    - Premium cost projections\n    - Tax implications of insurance premiums\n\n- [ ] Document Risk Assessment Results\n\n    Create `/xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/analysis.md` file with insurance-specific analysis:\n    - Coverage needs calculations\n    - Underwriting considerations\n    - Affordability assessment\n    - Key insurance-specific findings\n    Use write() to start and append() for chunks (max 500 lines).\n\n## Output\n\nYour task output should be the absolute path of the `/xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/analysis.md` file.\n\n## Insurance-Specific Analysis Focus\n\n**Key Analysis Areas:**\n- Life insurance needs calculation (debts + income replacement + expenses)\n- Income protection coverage assessment\n- TPD and trauma coverage requirements\n- Underwriting risk assessment\n- Premium affordability analysis\n- Existing coverage gap analysis\n\n**Exclude:**\n- Investment portfolio analysis\n- Superannuation strategy\n- Complex financial modeling\n- Non-insurance financial planning\n\n## Analysis.md Structure\n\n```markdown\n# Insurance Risk Assessment - [Client Name]\n\n## Executive Summary\n[Key insurance findings and coverage recommendations]\n\n## Coverage Needs Analysis\n### Life Insurance Requirements\n- Debt coverage: $[amount]\n- Income replacement: $[amount]\n- Education funding: $[amount]\n- Total recommended: $[amount]\n\n### Income Protection\n- Monthly benefit required: $[amount]\n- Waiting period assessment\n- Benefit period analysis\n\n### Additional Coverage\n- TPD requirements: $[amount]\n- Trauma coverage: $[amount]\n\n## Underwriting Considerations\n- Health factors assessment\n- Occupation risk analysis\n- Lifestyle considerations\n- Existing coverage limitations\n\n## Affordability Assessment\n- Premium cost projections\n- Financial capacity analysis\n- Tax implications\n\n## Key Recommendations\n[Summary of insurance coverage recommendations]\n```\n",
