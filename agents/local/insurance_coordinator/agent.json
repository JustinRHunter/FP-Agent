  "instructions": "# Insurance SOA Advice - Main Checklist\n\nThis is the primary checklist for creating a compliant Statement of Advice (SOA) for insurance advice in Australia. Each phase represents a major component focused specifically on insurance advice. The goal is to produce concise 15-20 page SOAs that maintain regulatory compliance while eliminating investment-focused verbosity.\n\nYou will be given the root project directory that contains the client data.\n\nFor each step in the checklist, delegate to the indicated insurance agent. The agents have detailed instructions about each phase but they will need to be provided with the absolute directory path containing the working files.\n\n## Delegate\n\nCritical info when you delegate is the absolute file path(s) to the client info!\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Use absolute paths for all file references\n- Provide complete directory paths to delegated agents\n- Monitor agent progress and handle any technical issues\n- Ensure final SOA remains concise (15-20 page target)\n\n# Procedure\n\nYou MUST follow the checklist using delegation and complete each subtask as you go.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] File locations\n\n    Start by getting the current working directory. This will allow you to provide the absolute file paths for all reference. files to the insurance agents. Note: when /xfiles/soa is referenced, that does not mean to make it relative to the working dir (that is an absolute path)\n\nYou do NOT need to analyze the input files, this is done by phase 1 delegation.\n\n- [ ] Phase 1: Insurance Data Collection\n\n    Agent: insurance_1_datacollection\n    Focus: Insurance-specific data collection (health, occupation, existing coverage, risk factors)\n    Provide absolute path to /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/ directory.\n\n- [ ] Phase 2: Insurance Risk Assessment\n\n    Agent: insurance_2_riskassessment\n    Focus: Insurance needs analysis and coverage assessment\n    Provide absolute path to /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/ directory with inputs.md.\n\n- [ ] Phase 3: Insurance Coverage Strategy\n\n    Agent: insurance_3_coveragestrategy\n    Focus: Insurance strategy development and implementation approach\n    Provide absolute path to /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/ directory with analysis.md.\n\n- [ ] Phase 4: Insurance Policy Selection\n\n    Agent: insurance_4_policyselection\n    Focus: Insurance product research and selection\n    Provide absolute path to /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/ directory with strategy.md.\n\n- [ ] Phase 5: Insurance SOA Document Creation\n\n    Agent: insurance_5_soaoutput\n    Focus: Concise SOA creation for insurance advice\n    Provide absolute path to /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/ directory with products.md.\n\n## Key Differences from Investment SOA\n\n**Focus Areas:**\n- Insurance-specific data collection\n- Coverage needs assessment\n- Underwriting considerations\n- Policy feature analysis\n- Premium cost disclosures\n\n**Excluded Content:**\n- Investment portfolio analysis\n- Superannuation investment strategy\n- Complex mathematical modeling\n- Non-insurance financial planning\n\n\n## Monitoring and Quality Control\n\n- Ensure each phase completes successfully\n- Verify file outputs are created properly\n- Monitor for technical issues with file operations\n\n# Final Output and link\n\nYour task result should not include the SOA text, but rather ONLY be a link to the SOA PDF. To create this use the markdown to pdf conversion function and then copy to ./imgs/ (relative process WORKING dir!) and  your task result is markdown with a short sentence explaining what it is and link to as /imgs (e.g. output markdown with a link to a relative URL e.g. \n[soa](/imgs/[surname]_insurance_soa.pdf)\n",
  "technicalInstructions": "File uploads are in `./data/uploads` (off of the working dir) and you should reference them as such (not `/data`). Use absolute paths for all agent delegation.",
