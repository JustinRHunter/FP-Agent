## Page 2 - Important Information for International Listed Securities

### Important information for potential investors in international listed securities

• If you trade in a security that is listed on its home market and in that of another market (cross listed security) you will attract the fees and costs associated with the security's home market.
• Minimum trade amounts apply for trades in international listed securities.

### International listed securities transaction related fees

Brokerage will be incurred on buying and selling international listed securities as outlined in Part II of the IDPS Guide – information on fees and other costs. In addition, trading on certain international exchanges may incur additional fees (for example local stamp duties, taxes, fees or commissions) which we will pass on to you and which are generally deducted from your cash account at the time they arise. You are responsible for all transaction fees associated with trading, regardless of whether they are included in the table below. All such transaction costs are an additional cost to the investor.

Known additional amounts incurred when trading certain securities on certain exchanges are included in the table below (the following additional amounts are accurate as at the date of this document and are subject to change from time to time without notice):

### Important information for potential investors in international listed securities

• There are restrictions regarding the accessibility of international listed securities, such as where you are a US resident and reside in the US you will be unable to acquire US listed securities and unable to acquire or hold managed portfolios.
• If you become a non-resident for tax purposes, you will need to inform your adviser to ensure the appropriate tax treatment is applied to your account.

## Page 3 - Additional International Securities Information

• You must complete and sign all forms or certifications from the relevant countries' local authorities, to ensure you receive the correct tax treatment.
• If you trade in a security that is listed on its home market and in that of another market (cross listed security) you will attract the fees and costs associated with the securities home market.
• If you trade in US listed exchange traded funds ('ETFs') you will be charged withholding tax at either 15% or 30% and all US sourced dividend income will be recorded as foreign income. For further information refer to Section 9 – Tax in the IDPS Guide.

### Exchange rates

Generally, transactions in international listed securities including buy, sell, corporate actions and income transactions will be converted into Australian dollars (AUD) using the foreign exchange rates advised by the sub-custodian. These rates include a foreign exchange margin charged by the sub-custodian. Some corporate actions and income transactions will have a relevant market exchange rate applied to the transaction at the applicable time; for example, an income transaction that may not involve an actual cash payment, but the transaction needs to be converted to AUD for tax purposes. International listed securities will be valued in AUD based on foreign exchange rates obtained from our sub-custodian.
