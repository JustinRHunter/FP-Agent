  "instructions": "# Insurance Phase 4: Policy Research & Selection\n\nThis phase researches and selects specific insurance policies to implement the strategy from Phase 3. Focus on insurance product comparison, cost analysis, and underwriting considerations. Use streamlined analysis focused on material product differences that impact client outcomes.\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- Use write() then append() for chunks (max 400 lines)\n- For Python analysis: write code to file first, then execute\n- Use absolute paths for all file operations\n- Mark subtasks as completed as you progress\n- Focus on insurance-specific product analysis\n\n**Reminder: do not attempt to write more than one section at a time, and be careful with formatting. Err on the side of caution and create a new append() if you are getting too long, because you will have to start the output over if it overruns the max output length.**\n\n## Input and Analysis\n\nRead the inputs.md, analysis.md, and /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance//xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/strategy.md files from previous phases.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [ ] Review Insurance Strategy\n\n    Read the /xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance//xfiles/soa/data/[client_surname]/insurance/strategy.md file to understand coverage requirements and strategic framework.\n\n- [ ] Research Insurance Products\n\n    Research appropriate insurance products for:\n    - Life insurance policies\n    - TPD coverage options\n    - Income protection products\n    - Trauma insurance policies\n    Focus on 2-3 main providers for each coverage type.\n\n- [ ] Compare Policy Features and Costs\n\n    Compare key policy features:\n    - Coverage definitions and exclusions\n    - Premium costs (exact dollar amounts)\n    - Underwriting requirements\n    - Claims processes\n    - Policy terms and conditions\n\n- [ ] Analyze Underwriting Implications\n\n    Assess underwriting considerations:\n    - Health and occupation factors\n    - Likely policy terms and exclusions\n    - Application process requirements\n    - Potential loading or exclusion impacts\n\n- [ ] Prepare Cost Analysis\n\n    Calculate total cost of ownership:\n    - First year premium costs\n    - 10-year cost projections\n    - Comparison with existing coverage\n    - Affordability assessment\n\n- [ ] Document Policy Selection\n\n    Create comprehensive `products.md` file:\n    - Selected policies with rationale\n    - Cost analysis and comparisons\n    - Underwriting considerations\n    - Implementation details\n    Use write() to start and append() for chunks (max 500 lines).\n\n## Output\n\nYour task output should be the absolute path of the `products.md` file.\n\n## Insurance Product Focus\n\n**Key Analysis Areas:**\n- Policy feature comparison\n- Premium cost analysis (exact dollar amounts)\n- Underwriting assessment\n- Provider due diligence\n- Cost-benefit analysis\n\n**Exclude:**\n- Investment product analysis\n- Portfolio optimization\n- Complex financial modeling\n- Non-insurance financial products\n\n## Products.md Structure\n\n```markdown\n# Insurance Policy Selection - [Client Name]\n\n## Selected Policies\n### Life Insurance\n**Provider:** [Provider Name]\n- Sum insured: $[amount]\n- Annual premium: $[exact amount]\n- Key features: [policy features]\n- Rationale: [selection reasoning]\n\n### Income Protection\n**Provider:** [Provider Name]\n- Monthly benefit: $[amount]\n- Annual premium: $[exact amount]\n- Waiting period: [days]\n- Benefit period: [duration]\n- Rationale: [selection reasoning]\n\n### Additional Coverage\n[TPD, trauma, etc. with similar structure]\n\n## Cost Analysis\n### Total Annual Premiums\n- Life insurance: $[amount]\n- Income protection: $[amount]\n- Other coverage: $[amount]\n- **Total:** $[amount]\n\n### Cost Comparison\n- Comparison with existing coverage\n- 10-year cost projections\n- Affordability assessment\n\n## Underwriting Considerations\n- Expected underwriting outcome\n- Potential exclusions or loadings\n- Application process requirements\n\n## Implementation Plan\n- Application sequence\n- Documentation requirements\n- Timing considerations\n\n## SOA-Ready Disclosures\n[Formatted fee disclosures and policy details for SOA inclusion]\n```\n",
