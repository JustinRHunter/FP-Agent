  "instructions": "# Phase 5: SOA Document Creation\n\nThis phase creates the complete SOA document following the comprehensive structure with all mandatory disclosures, mathematical analysis results, and compliance with Australian regulatory requirements.\n\n## Core Principles for Compliant SOA Construction\n\nEvery compliant Statement of Advice must adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n- **Act in the Client's Best Interests**: The primary principle - all advice must be in the client's best interests, with clear explanation of how recommendations achieve this\n- **Be Clear, Concise, and Effective**: Document must be easy to understand, avoiding jargon and presenting information logically\n- **Provide Sufficient Information for Informed Decision**: Include all necessary information for client decision-making, including basis of advice, risks, and all costs\n- **Be Tailored and Personalised**: Advice must be specific to client's individual circumstances, objectives, financial situation, and needs\n- **Disclose All Relevant Information**: Complete transparency regarding conflicts of interest, fees, commissions, and benefits\n- **Maintain a Complete Record**: SOA serves as critical legal record - must be accurate, complete, and document rationale for recommendations\n\n---\n\n## Output file\n\nWrite the file to the same directory as the strategy.md, products.md, etc., filename: `soa.md`\nOutput one section at a time, starting with write() and then append() for each section.\nIf a section is longer than 400 or so lines, you will need to append() another chunk.\n\nBe very careful about formatting.\n\nImportant: do not attempt output more than one section at a time. You can overrun your max token output length. Also, you must mark each section subtask as completed as you go. For long sections, do not try to output the full section at once. Instead, do multiple append() calls for the section.\n\n## File Size and Running Python Code\n\nIf necessary, you may run python code. This is _might_ be necessary to solidify real numbers based on final selected products.\n\nDo not attempt to run python in a single command. Rather, first write() the python code to a file and then execute it.\n\nThere is a limit to the size of output possible at once. \nIf the file is longer than 500 lines, write() the first chunk and then use append() for more chunks.\nThis goes for all files with write() or append(), not just Python, so use the chunked approach for analysis file output also.\n\nThere is a utility module in /xfiles/soa/soa_financial_utils.py. Read this in first. You can use it if it some of it applies.\n\nWhile doing analysis (if necessary), do NOT move on to the next step until you have receive the result from the system of your command executions with\nscript output and completed your analysis of that part.\n\n## Document Structure Checklist\n\n- [ ] Read the inputs\n\n    Read the input files: inputs.md, analysis.md, strategy.md, and product.md\n\n- [ ] Section 1 Cover Page and Introduction\n\n    Insert AR name, number, and contact details. Include licensee name, AFS licence number, and contact details. Add advice date and 30-day validity period. Explain SOA purpose as legally required record demonstrating adherence to professional obligations. Include document expiry notice and identification of \"providing entity\" for legal compliance.\n\n- [ ] Section 2 Client's Financial Objectives, Situation, and Needs\n\n    Document comprehensive fact-finding results as foundation of entire SOA. Include client's investment objectives in their own words, current financial position (assets, liabilities, income, expenses), personal circumstances, timeline and motivation. Ensure objectives are specific and measurable (e.g., \"retire at 65 with $60,000 annual income\"). This section demonstrates compliance with best interests duty by showing advice is based on client's specific circumstances.\n\n- [ ] Section 3 Scope of the Advice\n\n    Define explicitly what advice covers and excludes using Phase 1 scope validation. Include specific areas like asset allocation, product selection, contribution strategies. Document exclusions with risk explanations and future advice arrangements. Address \"scaled advice\" concept where client seeks advice only on specific issues. This manages professional obligations and liability by setting clear expectations.\n\n- [ ] Section 4 Summary of Recommendations\n\n    Provide high-level bullet-point summary of key investment recommendations from Phase 4 product selection. Include strategic asset allocation, main product recommendations, implementation timeline, and key strategies. Present in table or bullet format for easy client comprehension. This allows client to grasp core advice before detailed explanations.\n\n- [ ] Section 5 Current Financial Situation Analysis\n\n    Summarize detailed financial position using Phase 2 analysis results. Include income, expenses, assets, liabilities with key metrics. Document existing investments, current asset allocation, and cash flow analysis with monthly surplus figures. Show marginal tax rate and investment capacity calculations. This provides clear link between client's situation and subsequent recommendations.\n\n- [ ] Section 6 Basis of the Advice and Rationale\n\n    Present comprehensive rationale demonstrating appropriateness and best interests duties. Explain strategies considered and reasoning for chosen recommendations using Phase 3 strategy development. Include mathematical rationale for asset allocation, expected return projections, and scenario modeling from Phase 2. Document investigation process and alternatives considered with rejection rationale. This is the core legal and professional justification for the advice.\n\n- [ ] Section 7 Detailed Investment Recommendations\n\n    Present specific product recommendations from Phase 4 with detailed fee analysis. Include recommended asset allocation percentages, specific products with features and benefits, implementation sequence and contribution strategy. Show expected return projections and risk analysis. Provide clear explanation of how recommendations align with client objectives.\n\n- [ ] Section 8 Product Recommendations and Comparisons\n\n    Detail specific financial products recommended. If switching existing investments, create comparison table using `fee_impact_comparison()` results. Document switching costs, benefits, and break-even analysis using `break_even_analysis()`. Include tax implications, timing considerations, and any lost benefits (insurance cover, exit fees). Show true cost understanding for client decision-making.\n\n- [ ] Section 9 Important Information and Risk Disclosures\n\n    Include investment risks using Phase 2 market downturn analysis results. Document ongoing obligations like rebalancing frequency from Phase 3. Include review requirements, implementation steps, cooling-off periods, and client rights. Provide warning if advice is based on incomplete or inaccurate client information. This ensures client understands all consequences and risks.\n\n- [ ] Section 10 Best Interests Duty Evidence\n\n    Document investigation process conducted across all phases. Summarize any alternatives considered in each phase with rationale for rejections. Explain how recommendations align with client objectives and broader circumstances (FASEA Standard 6). Demonstrate that advice prioritizes client's best interests over adviser's interests. This provides legal evidence of duty compliance.\n\n- [ ] Section 11 Fees and Remuneration\n\n    Provide exact dollar disclosure of all advice fees (no percentages for transparency). Include product commissions using dollar amounts from Phase 4 fee analysis. Disclose what adviser receives vs what licensee receives. Show true cost of advice and ongoing services. Disclose any conflicts of interest and management approach. This supports consumer protection and transparency requirements.\n\n- [ ] Section 12 Disclosures and Warnings\n\n    Include all mandatory disclosures:\n    - Any interests, associations, or relationships that could influence advice\n    - Professional indemnity insurance details\n    - Complaints and dispute resolution process information\n    - Warning about advice based on incomplete/inaccurate information\n    - Licensee's potential conflicts of interest\n    - Client rights and cooling-off periods\n    This addresses potential conflicts and provides clear recourse path for clients.\n\n- [ ] Section 13 Next Steps and Implementation\n\n    Outline implementation process with specific steps and timeline. List required documentation and application processes. Include follow-up meeting schedule and ongoing review arrangements. Provide contact information for questions and clarifications. Ensure client understands practical next steps.\n\n- [ ] Section 14 Authority to Proceed\n\n    Include formal acknowledgment section where client can confirm they have read and understood the advice and agree to proceed with recommendations. While not strictly legally required, this serves as important record of client consent and final understanding check. Often required by licensees for risk management. Include client signature and date fields.\n\n---\n\n## Final task output\n\nThe task output should be the absolute file path of the `soa.md` file.\n\n\n## Key Mathematical Data to Include\n\n### **From Phase 2 Analysis**\n- Marginal tax rate and investment capacity calculations\n- Retirement adequacy projections with scenario modeling\n- Current portfolio fee breakdown in dollar amounts\n- Market risk scenario outcomes and stress testing\n- Cash flow analysis with surplus/deficit calculations\n\n### **From Phase 3 Strategy**\n- Strategic asset allocation percentages with rationale\n- Rebalancing triggers and frequency recommendations\n- Contribution amounts and timing optimization\n- Risk-return trade-off analysis\n\n### **From Phase 4 Products**\n- Specific product fees in exact dollar amounts over time\n- Comprehensive fee comparison analysis over 10-20 years\n- After-tax return calculations and projections\n- Break-even analysis for product switches\n- Cost-benefit analysis of recommendations\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\n### **Mandatory Disclosures**\n- All fees in exact dollar amounts (reg 7.7.11B, 7.7.13B)\n- Conflicts of interest and management approach\n- Professional indemnity insurance details\n- Complaints and dispute resolution process\n- Cooling-off periods and client rights\n- Product switching consequences if applicable\n- Warning about incomplete information\n\n### **Best Interests Duty Evidence**\n- Comprehensive investigation conducted across all phases\n- Alternatives considered with detailed rejection rationale\n- Client priorities and alignment demonstration\n- Broader circumstances consideration (FASEA Standard 6)\n- Documentation of advice prioritizing client interests\n\n### **Appropriateness Duty Evidence**\n- Detailed fact-finding documentation\n- Suitability analysis for client's circumstances\n- Risk tolerance alignment\n- Objective achievement pathway\n\n### **FASEA Code Compliance**\n- Standard 1: Client's best interests prioritized with evidence\n- Standard 3: Quality advice with proper investigation documented\n- Standard 4: Client understanding verification processes\n- Standard 6: Broader circumstances considered and documented\n\n## Document Quality Standards\n\n- **Clear, concise, and effective** presentation (s947B(6), s947C(6))\n- **Plain English** throughout the document avoiding jargon\n- **Logical flow** from fact-finding to recommendations to implementation\n- **Mathematical consistency** across all sections and phases\n- **Professional formatting** with consistent structure and presentation\n- **Complete legal record** for regulatory and professional compliance\n- **Tailored and personalised** content specific to client circumstances\n\n## Key Outputs from Phase 5\n\n- Complete 14-section SOA document meeting all regulatory requirements\n- All mandatory disclosures included with proper legal compliance\n- Mathematical analysis integrated throughout with phase consistency\n- Best interests and appropriateness duty evidence comprehensively documented\n- Exact dollar fee disclosures for complete transparency\n- Clear implementation pathway with practical next steps\n- Professional presentation ready for client with authority to proceed\n- Complete legal record demonstrating professional obligation compliance\n- Client consent documentation for risk management\n\n## Risk Management and Record Keeping\n\n- SOA serves as critical legal record of advice provided\n- Documents adviser's adherence to professional and ethical obligations\n- Provides evidence of regulatory compliance for ASIC requirements\n- Supports dispute resolution with comprehensive rationale documentation\n- Demonstrates investigation process and decision-making framework\n- Records client consent and understanding verification\n",
